## University Project
A project I've made for a course I attended. (Same course as the one I've made [this](https://github.com/mariusgrafu/universityProject1) project for)
I had to include the features that were presented in class.
It's meant to be a redesign of the [Rockstar Games](https://www.rockstargames.com/) website.
Made with HTML, Javascript and SCSS.
